## Deprecation notices

### 32-bit support

Support for 32-bit Intel Linux and Intel Windows will most probably
be dropped in 2022. Support for 32-bit Arm Linux will be preserved
for a while, due to the large user base of 32-bit Raspberry Pi systems.

### Linux minimum requirements

Support for RedHat 7 will most probably be dropped in 2022, and the
minimum requirement will be raised to GLIBC 2.27, available starting
with Ubuntu 18 and RedHat 8.
